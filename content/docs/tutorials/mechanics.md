# Mechanics

This page walks you through obtaining all the mechanical parts required for
building a 3dasd scanner. Most of the chassis can be 3d-printed, but there are
a few metal pieces that hold everything together.

## The metal parts

You need a couple nuts and bolts and also some ball bearings. Here's the
shopping list:

| Item              | Quantity |
|-------------------|------|
| M2 nut            | 3  |
| M3 nut            | 10 |
| M4 nut            | 13 |
| M2 10 bolt        | 3 |
| M3 6 bolt         | 2 |
| M3 8 bolt         | 4 |
| M3 12 bolt        | 4 |
| M4 10 bolt        | 4 |
| M4 16 bolt        | 1 |
| M4 20 bolt        | 1 |
| M4 25 bolt        | 3 |
| M4 40 bolt        | 4 |
| 50x72x12 bearing  | 1 |
| 6x13x5 bearing    | 3 |

**Understanding the dimensions**

`50x72x12` bearing means:
- 50mm inner diameter ("bore diameter")
- 72mm outer diameter
- 12mm width ("raceway width").

`M4 25` bolt means:
- M4 metric bolt (4mm outer diameter)
- 25mm long (nominal length, without the head)

**Bolt heads**

I'm using [`DIN7985`](https://www.fasteners.eu/standards/DIN/7985/) bolts but
anything similar should work fine.
