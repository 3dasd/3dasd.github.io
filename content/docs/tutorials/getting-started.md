# Getting started

This an overview of the steps required for building your own scanner. See the
links below for the detailed instructions on every topic.

## Electronics

You can order the main PCB with most components already soldered in place from
JLCPCB. You will also need a couple components separately (e.g. motors,
Raspberry Pi, etc.).

For the complete parts list and assembly instructions see
[Electronics]({{< relref "/docs/tutorials/electronics" >}}).

## 3D-printing

All the mechanical parts are 3D-printed. It takes around 20 hours to print
everything with an average printer.

See [3D-printing]({{< relref "/docs/tutorials/3d-printing" >}}) for details.

## Assembly

Once you have everything it's time to assemble the scanner.

See [Assembly]({{< relref "/docs/tutorials/assembly" >}}) for details.

## Software

With everything wired up you will need to install the 3dasd software components
on the scanner.

See [Software]({{< relref "/docs/tutorials/software" >}}) for details.
