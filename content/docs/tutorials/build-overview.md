# Build overview

This is an overview of the steps required for building your scanner. See the
links below for the detailed instructions on every topic.

## Electronics

You need to order two PCBs and a couple electronic components first. Then solder
things together (pretty basic through-hole soldering only!). Once everything's
set up, you need to do a little calibration and assemble a few cables.

## Mechanics

Almost all of the mechanical parts are 3D-printed. It takes around 20 hours to
print everything. You also need to get a couple nuts and bolts and also a few
ball bearings and magnets.

## Assembly

Once you have all the parts ready it's time to assemble the scanner.

> See [Assembly]({{< relref "/docs/tutorials/assembly" >}}) for all the details.

## Software

With everything wired up you will need to install the software components on the
scanner.
