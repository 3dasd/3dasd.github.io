# Assembly

Once you have all the mechanic components printed and all the electronics
soldered together, it's time to assemble the scanner.

## Power plug into chassis

This step isn't absolutely necessary but I highly recommend gluing the
`scanner-power-supply` PCB into its place inside the `purple` piece of the
chassis. Make sure the power plug is facing outwards.
