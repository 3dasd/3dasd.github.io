# 3dasd

Welcome to `3dasd.com`, home for a fully open-source room-scale 3D scanner.

{{< hint info >}}
**Work in progress!**  
This site and this whole project is in a very early stage. Everything is subject to
change and hopefully improvement. If you're looking for a mature product, please
check back later! (;
{{< /hint >}}

## What's this all about?

This site is here to help building a room-scale 3D scanner like this:

{{< container-image path="images/scanner-photo-2021-04-01.jpg" >}}

The goal is to provide everyone with the instructions to build a cheap
room-scale 3D scanner.

## Who is this for?

The goal is to make this as accessible as possible! However, at this point you
need to have access to a 3D printer, do some very basic soldering and assemble
a few cables (JST connectors).

## Is it any good?

[Yes](https://about.gitlab.com/is-it-any-good/). Check out the [examples page](https://examples.3dasd.com) for measurements taken with the scanner.
