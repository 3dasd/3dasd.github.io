# 3dasd

Welcome to `3dasd.com`, home for a fully open-source DIY room-scale 3D scanner.

{{< hint info >}}
**Work in progress!**  
This site and this whole project is in a very early stage. Everything is subject
to change and hopefully improvement. If you're looking for a mature product,
please check back later! (;

## What's this all about?

This site is here to help building a room-scale 3D scanner like this:

{{< container-image path="images/scanner-photo-2021-04-01.jpg" >}}

The goal is to provide everyone with the instructions to build a cheap
room-scale 3D scanner.

## Who is this for?

The goal is to make this as accessible as possible! However, at this point you
need to have access to a 3D printer, do some very basic soldering and assemble
a few cables (JST connectors).

## Is it any good?

[Yes](https://about.gitlab.com/is-it-any-good/)! Well, okay, it depends. (:

This is not a production-grade scanner, it's way too slow and just not accurate
enough for most real-world applications. It could be a great entry into the
world of 3D scanning though.

Check out the [examples page](https://examples.3dasd.com) for measurements taken
with the scanner.

This project started off as the combination of two Youtube videos:

- ["Making a Lidar scanner in the home shop with a lathe, a pair of STM32s, and a Garmin Lidar Lite"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGN82vLjguI)
by **David Cambridge**. This was the original inspiration for 3dasd.
- ["3D Printed DSLR Camera Pan Tilt Mount (Arduino/Stepper Driven) 2020"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJO7mv4-0PY)
by **isaac879**. This has inspired the mechanical design and also parts of the
software was borrowed from here.
